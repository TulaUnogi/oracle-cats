  - ## Design:

       - #### Colour Scheme: 
        
            1. Main colours used for the text and buttons are the shades of blue and white as they work well with the background and provide a good contrast.
            2. Dominating colours in the background picture are the shades of blue, brown and white.
            
       - #### Typography:
        
            1. Inknut Antiqua and Julius Sans One have been chosen as the headings and body fonts as they've been used in the logo and they as they are simple but not too minimalistic and provide aesthetically pleasing experience for a User.            
            2. Fallback fonts used in case of the main fonts not being imported into the site:
                - Arial, sans-serif as a fallback for Julius Sans One,
                - Impact, serif as a fallback for Inknut Antiqua.
            
       - #### Imagery:
        
            1. Imagery in this project plays essensial role. The background picture of a cat intensively staring into Space sets the initial mood for the User. The logo includes the cat's head and indicates the website's strong correlation with cats. Thanks to that Users from their very first moments are introduced to the idea behind the site not only by the direct text content, but also through visuals.
